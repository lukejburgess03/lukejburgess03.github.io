	<h1>Arrests for Adults Under 18 in Each New York County</h1>
	<p>Arrests throughout New York are of course prevalent in every county, but where the population increases, we also see a step increase in crime as well. New York City and it's surrounding counties really have a sheer domination of numbers when it comes to isolated incidents. But of course, that is largely due to the fact that there are so many more people</p>
    <blockquote>"When crime goes down, jobs go up. When crime goes down, quality of life goes up. When crime goes down, opportunity goes up. That's what we're delivering in New York City!"
