<h1>Republicans, on brink of governing
   'trifecta,'' look to overhaul Washington</h1>

<p>Republican lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill on Tuesday with some spring in their step.</p>

<p>After winning the presidency and the Senate majority, the party is on the cusp of regaining the House majority — and with it, 
  a powerful governing “trifecta” in Washington.</p>

<p>Though control of the House may not be called for days, GOP lawmakers will this week work on the assumption they've clinched it, 
 pushing ahead with House leadership elections and shaping plans to reverse or 
  overhaul much of the Biden administration's domestic and foreign policy.
  </p>

<p>“We're going to raise an America First banner above this 
    place,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said Tuesday on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>Republicans in the House and Senate, he said, have a mandate to implement Trump's policies. 
  Johnson said he plans to spend the weekend at Mar-a-Lago “to iron out details on the plans ahead,” including 
  lowering costs, significantly scaling back environmental regulations, and ending 
  “wokeness and radical gender ideology.”</p>

<p>Republican lawmakers have said that their first priority for the 119th Congress will be passing policies aimed at securing the 
  southern border. A top candidate to lead Senate Republicans vowed Monday to “take a hatchet to the 
  regulatory apparatus” as the conference's second priority. They also plan to quickly reauthorize 
  President-elect Donald Trump's 2017 tax law and other budgetary measures.
</p>

<p>One question is how Trump will seek to shape the agenda. Trump quickly made clear he wants the Republican-led Senate to bend to his will when it comes to his appointments, 
  asserting that he plans to go around the chamber for some nominees. His allies, meanwhile, loudly lined up behind Sen. Rick Scott (Florida) for GOP leader, although Trump himself 
  has not endorsed in the secret-ballot race.
</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers, who maintain that they still have a narrow path to the House majority, 
  will be focused this week on confirming as many judges as possible in the Senate in 
  the dwindling days of their majority.</p>

<p>There are about two dozen judicial nominations already awaiting votes in the Senate Judiciary
   Committee and on the Senate floor, but some of them do not have bipartisan support, making
    their path more difficult.</p>

<p>“We are going to get as many done as we can,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer 
  (D-New York) said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>House Democrats plan on having “soul searching” conversations about how the party should move 
  ahead. “From our perspective as House Democrats, I think we're going to have a family conversation 
  that's going to be clear-eyed, candid, and comprehensive to figure out what happened on election night,” 
  Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) told CBS Mornings Tuesday.
