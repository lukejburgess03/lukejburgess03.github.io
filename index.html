                    According to Auryanna Walters, a massage therapist in training, she often has to deal with not only the physical side of people's anxities, but also the mental side. She talked about how raising boys can be a very challenging task, and as she grew up in a household of mainly women, it has been a very interesting step in her life to see how young boys interact and develop. She spoke about how young heterosexual men often build up a shield to defend themselves from emotional breakdown. That's something that is displayed in pop culture and taught to kids from a very young age.

                    <strong>Another Perspective:</strong> 
                    Other experts have highlighted similar challenges, pointing out that societal norms often discourage men from expressing vulnerability. This creates a barrier to addressing emotional health issues early. Programs focused on mentorship, education, and supportive environments have shown promise in breaking these barriers and encouraging young men to prioritize mental health.

    <p><strong>What makes this the case?:</strong> Men's mental health month comes around every June. But the reality is, that we often do not think about just how much mental health around younger men can really be something unspoken for much of the year, and the evidence makes it clear that as a society, we need to do much much better. Mental health disorders are on the rise globally, and young men are no exception. Studies reveal that suicide is a leading cause of death among men aged 15–24. The stigma surrounding mental health and societal expectations of masculinity exacerbate these issues. Many young men are reluctant to seek help due to the fear of being perceived as weak or "unmanly."

        One concerning trend is the correlation between social media use and declining mental health. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat often promote unrealistic standards of success, appearance, and masculinity. Young men face immense pressure to project an image of confidence and achievement, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and loneliness.
        
        Moreover, the pandemic has further strained mental health for many. Isolation, financial instability, and the disruption of routines have intensified feelings of anxiety and depression. For young men, who may already struggle to articulate their emotions, this disruption can be particularly damaging.</p>

        <p><strong>There are many things we can do to help, but where does it start?:</strong> Creating a safe space for young men to express their feelings is crucial. Families, friends, and educators should model vulnerability and emphasize that asking for help is a sign of strength. Programs like mental health workshops and peer support groups can help normalize these conversations. Its time to redefine masculinity to include traits like empathy, compassion, and self-awareness. Campaigns and initiatives that challenge traditional stereotypes can empower young men to embrace a healthier, more balanced sense of identity. While social media has its drawbacks, it can also be a powerful tool for spreading awareness and connecting young men with support networks. Apps and platforms that focus on mental health make mental health resources more accessible.</p>

        <p><strong>What can we do about it?:</strong> The mental health of young men is not just an individual issue—it is a societal one. Addressing this crisis requires a collective effort to challenge stigmas, promote awareness, and improve access to resources. Policymakers must prioritize funding for mental health programs, while media platforms should take responsibility for the content they promote.</p>

        <p><strong>Where do we go from here?:</strong> The mental health crisis among young men is a complex issue rooted in cultural, social, and systemic factors. However, it is not insurmountable. By fostering open dialogue, breaking down barriers to care, and promoting positive role models, we can pave the way for a brighter future. Young men deserve to be seen, heard, and supported in their journey toward mental well-being. Let us rise to the challenge and make that a reality.</p>
